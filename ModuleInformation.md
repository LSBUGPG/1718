# Module statement

In Game Programming will explore key concepts in programming, within the context of their own game project. The module introduces students to the Unity development environment (a commonly used engine in the game industry) and over the course of the module students will not only develop their understanding of the fundamentals of game programming, but further develop their understanding of the game production processes learned in year 1. Each week students learn about key programming concepts that they will be expected to apply towards the creation of a small game. Students will also be expected to schedule and accurately track their programming tasks. Thus, the module will not only provide students with a conceptual understanding of programming, but will provide them with key project planning and management skill which they can then apply to the year 3 Advanced Game Project module.

# Employability statement

This module introduces students to a highly sought after job role in the game industry: that of the programmer. After completing the module students will understand programming fundamentals and be able to write code that can be understood and used by members of professional game development teams. While students may not wish to pursue a career as a programmer, the module will give students knowledge and lexicon to effectively collaborate with programmers.

# Module assessment

The assessment for the module comprises 2 parts:  

## Coursework 1

A game component programming project, e.g. an A.I. script to battle other A.I. scripts in an arena working as a group or individually. Supported by weekly learning journal, programming task log, four self-selected programming assignments, and four peer assessments (worth 25% of the marks for the module.)

## Coursework 2

A small video game project demonstrating an understanding of the programming techniques developed by yourself and your peers over the course. Supported by weekly learning journal, programming task log, two peer programming task specifications, two peer assigned programming tasks, and two assessments of peer work (worth 75% of the marks for the module.)
