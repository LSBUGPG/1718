## Student Lotto

Write your name on a lolly stick.

## Look ahead

* Questions? Fears? Anxieties?
* [Overview of the module](ModuleInformation)
* Learning techniques 
* What can go wrong
* Introduction to programming
* Programming exercise
* Homework

## Learning objectives

Students completing this module, should be able to:

* create a personal learning plan
* break a game design into software components
* write, edit, test, and debug your own components
* use version control for collaborative programming
* identify the limitations of target hardware
* create a programming project schedule

### Feedback

do we need to add, remove, or edit anything?

## Learning techniques

In this module we'll be using several modern teaching / learning techniques:

* Learning how to learn
* Assessment for Learning
* Growth mindset
* Number talks
* Rubber duck debugging

### Learning how to learn

* focused and diffuse modes of thinking
* chunking
* pomadoro technique
* testing your recall

### Assessment for Learning

Assessment for Learning is a collection of techniques to ensure that, as students, you know:

* what you are learning
* why you are learning it
* where you are now
* where you need to get to
* how you are going to get there
* and how to know when you've arrived

* traffic lights
* peer assessment

### Peer assessment

* constructive feedback
* two stars and a wish

## What can go wrong

* cognitive distortions
* imposter syndrome
* procrastination
* learned helplessness

### Research cognitive distortions
* what are cognitive distortions?
* what is your most common automatic thought?

## What is programming?

* Computer Science
* a new language?
* a new literacy

## Programming unplugged

This is an exercise to show where the difficulty lies in programming. It should also help you develop your empathy skills.

### Part 1
* make a small Lego model, about 6 pieces
* don't show this to anyone else
* record your model (take a picure of it from a couple of angles)
* separate your model into pieces
* write down a list of instructions to put your model together (words only, no pictures)

### Part 2
* give your instructions and pieces to someone else
* try to build someone else's model from their instructions

### Part 3
* compare the result to your original
* identify instructions that didn't produce the intended result
* highlight those parts
* think about how could you improve those instructions?

## Recall

How do you do rubber duck debugging?

What's a good technique to avoid procrastination?

What are cognitive distortions?

What is your most common automatic thought?

## Homework

* Play a 'choose your own' adventure
* make yourself a GitHub account and email me your username
* find yourself a 'rubber duck'
