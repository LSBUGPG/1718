# Week Three

## Look ahead

* checklist
* review last week
* focus
* cognitive distortions
* questions

## Checklist:

* Anyone missing from student lotto?
* Has everyone signed up for GitHub?
* Did everyone bring a (named) rubber duck?
* Check GitHub works on student machines
* Check the whiteboard for touch input and audio

## Review

* Learning how to learn
* Cognitive distortions
* Avoiding procrastination tips
* A new literacy
* Programming unplugged
* Adventure games feedback

## Focus mode

In focus mode you use your working memory to learn stuff. But your working memory is limited. You can find out how much working memory you have by playing a simple game. You will need:

* random number generator (e.g. a dice)
* pencil and paper
* 1 friend

Generate 4 random numbers and get your friend to write them down in order (where you can't see.) Now try to recite the numbers in reverse order. If you can do it, try again with 5 numbers, then 6, until you hit the limit of your working memory.

## Cognitive distortions

Why cover cognitive distortions:

- history of this course
- programming is hard (you've already had a taste)
- buiding grit and getting into the right mindset

Some common automatic thoughts. What do these mean? Research:

- Filtering
- Polarized Thinking / “Black and White” Thinking
- Overgeneralization
- Labeling
- Mindreading / Jumping to Conclusions
- Catastrophizing
- Personalization
- Fallacy of Fairness / Shoulds, Musts, Oughts
- Emotional Reasoning
- Heaven’s Reward Fallacy

Dealing with automatic thoughts. Make a table:

Date and Time | Thought | Category | Evidence
--------------|---------|----------|---------
09/10/17 09:00| Everybody hates me | Overgeneralisation | There are people that like me too
09/10/17 09:20| I'm stupid | Labeling | Everyone makes mistakes
... | ... | ... | ...
