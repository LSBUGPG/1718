## Focus mode

In focus mode you use your working memory to learn stuff. But your working memory is limited. You can find out how much working memory you have by playing a simple game. You will need:

* random number generator (e.g. a dice)
* pencil and paper
* 1 friend

Generate 4 random numbers and get your friend to write them down in order (where you can't see.) Now try to recite the numbers in reverse order. If you can do it, try again with 5 numbers, then 6, until you hit the limit of your working memory.
