# Week Three

## Look ahead

* checklist
* review last week
* focus
* cognitive distortions
* evidence game
* automatic thoughts
* questions

## Checklist:

* Anyone missing from student lotto?
* Has everyone signed up for GitHub?
* Did everyone bring a (named) rubber duck?
* Check GitHub works on student machines
* Check the whiteboard for touch input and audio

## Review

* Learning how to learn
* Cognitive distortions
* Avoiding procrastination tips
* A new literacy
* Programming unplugged
* Adventure games feedback

## Focus mode

In focus mode you use your working memory to learn stuff. But your working memory is limited. You can find out how much working memory you have by playing a simple game. You will need:

* random number generator (e.g. a dice)
* pencil and paper
* 1 friend

Generate 4 random numbers and get your friend to write them down in order (where you can't see.) Now try to recite the numbers in reverse order. If you can do it, try again with 5 numbers, then 6, until you hit the limit of your working memory.

## Cognitive distortions

Why cover cognitive distortions:

- history of this course
- programming is hard (you've already had a taste)
- [Leaned Helplessness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmFOmprTt0)
- building grit and getting into the right mindset

Do some research and tell me, what is the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.

## Evidence game

I have a rule for generating numbers. I can't tell you what my rule is, but I can give you a sequence of numbers that follows my rule. You need to guess what my rule is. But all you can do is give me a sequence of numbers and asking if it follows my rule.

## Countering your automatic thoughts.

Some common automatic thought categories. What do these mean? Research:

- Filtering
- Polarized Thinking / “Black and White” Thinking
- Overgeneralization
- Labeling
- Mindreading / Jumping to Conclusions
- Catastrophizing
- Personalization
- Fallacy of Fairness / Shoulds, Musts, Oughts
- Emotional Reasoning
- Heaven’s Reward Fallacy

Dealing with automatic thoughts. Make a table:

Date and Time | Thought | Category | Evidence
--------------|---------|----------|---------
10/10/17 09:00| Everybody hates me | Overgeneralisation | There are people that like me too
10/10/17 09:20| I'm stupid | Labeling | Everyone makes mistakes
... | ... | ... | ...

## Square roots

- what is a square root?
- when might you need to use a square root?
- how do you calculate the square root of a number?

## Questions

What size is your working memory?

Describe the growth mindset.

What is your most common automatic thought? And how will you counter it?
